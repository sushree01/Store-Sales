Predicting the Store Sales

This is a regression dataset where depending on the various independent features, we need to predict the sales of a store. I have used holidays as per USHolidayCalender since the dataset had no clear description regarding the state holidays. I have used various regression models to predict the result and have evaluated the model on the basis of RMSE and R2 score.
